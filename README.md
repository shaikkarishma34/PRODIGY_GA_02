# PRODIGY_GA_02 – Text-to-Image Generation

This project is part of my **Generative AI Internship at Prodigy InfoTech**.

In this task, I worked on **text-to-image generation** using a pre-trained **Stable Diffusion** model.  
The goal was to generate images from natural language prompts and understand how modern generative models create visual content.

## What I did
- Used Stable Diffusion for text-to-image generation  
- Ran the model on GPU (T4) using Google Colab  
- Generated images from multiple text prompts  
- Saved and reviewed the generated outputs  

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Hugging Face Diffusers  
- Stable Diffusion  
- Google Colab  

## Output
The repository includes:
- A Jupyter Notebook with the implementation  
- A sample image generated from a text prompt  

## Internship Details
- **Track Code:** GA (Generative AI)  
- **Organization:** Prodigy InfoTech  

This task helped me understand how text prompts can be transformed into images using generative models, and gave me hands-on experience with real-world AI tools.
